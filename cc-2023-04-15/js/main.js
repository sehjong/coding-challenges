// PREP

// In this Kata, you will be given two strings a and b and your task will be to return the characters that are not common in the two strings.

// For example:

// solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc" 
// --The first string has 'yb' which is not in the second string. 
// --The second string has 'zc' which is not in the first string. 
// Notice also that you return the characters from the first string concatenated with those from the second string.

// P: two strings of letters
// R: the characters that are not common in the two strings,
//    with the characters from the first string concatenated
//    with those from the second string
// E: solve("xyab","xzca") = "ybzc"
// P:

// create a function that takes in two strings of letters
function solve(a, b) {
    
}
