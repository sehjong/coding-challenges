// PREP

// You will get an array of numbers.

// Every preceding number is smaller than the one following it.

// Some numbers will be missing, for instance:

// [-3,-2,1,5] //missing numbers are: -1,0,2,3,4
// Your task is to return an array of those missing numbers:

// [-1,0,2,3,4]

// P: an array of numbers,
//    where every preceding number is smaller than the one following it,
//    and some numbers will be missing
// R: an array containing all the missing numbers in the sequence,
//    sorted in ascending order
// E: [-3,-2,1,5] //missing numbers are: -1,0,2,3,4
//    Your task is to return an array of those missing numbers:
//    [-1,0,2,3,4]
// P:

// create a function that takes in an array of numbers,
// where every preceding number is smaller than the one following it,
// and some numbers will be missing
