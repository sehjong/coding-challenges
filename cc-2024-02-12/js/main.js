// PREP

// You have to search all numbers from inclusive 1 to inclusive a given number x, that have the given digit d in it.
// The value of d will always be 0 - 9.
// The value of x will always be greater than 0.

// You have to return as an array

// the count of these numbers,
// their sum
// and their product.

// For example:
// x = 11
// d = 1
// ->
// Numbers: 1, 10, 11
// Return: [3, 22, 110]

// If there are no numbers, which include the digit, return [0,0,0].

// P: a number x representing the upper limit of the range to search within, inclusive,
//    the value of which will always be greater than 0,
//    and a number d between 0 and 9, inclusive, representing the digit to search for within the numbers
// R: an array containing the count of numbers within the range 1 to x that contain the digit d,
//    the sum of these numbers, and the product of these numbers,
//    if no numbers are found, the product is 0
// E: x = 11
//    d = 1
//    ->
//    Numbers: 1, 10, 11
//    Return: [3, 22, 110]
// P: 

// create a function that takes in a number x representing the upper limit of the range to search within, inclusive,
// the value of which will always be greater than 0,
// and a number d between 0 and 9, inclusive, representing the digit to search for within the numbers
function findNums(x, d) {
