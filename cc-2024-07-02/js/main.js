/*
Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

For example, the score of test is 64 (20 + 5 + 19 + 20).

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

// P: a string of words
// R: the string representing the word with the highest score,
//    each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.,
//    if two words have the same score, the word that appears first in the input string is returned
// E: console.log(highestScoringWord('abc cba'), 'abc');
//    console.log(highestScoringWord('test', 'case'), 'test');
//    console.log(highestScoringWord('this is a test sentence with words of varying scores'), 'varying');
