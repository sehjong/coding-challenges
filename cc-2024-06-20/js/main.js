// PREP

/*
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b keeping their order.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/

// P: an array of numbers from which elements will be removed,
//    and another array of numbers specifying the elements to be removed from the initial array
// R: an array of numbers representing the difference between the arrays,
//    where all elements from the second array are removed from the initial array
// E: console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2], [1]), [2]);
//    console.log(arrayDiff([1, 2, 2, 2, 3], [2]), [1, 3]);
// P:

// create a function that takes in an array of numbers from which elements will be removed,
// and another array of numbers specifying the elements to be removed from the initial array
function arrayDiff(a, b) {
    
}
