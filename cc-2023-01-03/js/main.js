// PREP

// In this kata you should simply determine, whether a given year is a leap year or not. In case you don't know the rules, here they are:

// years divisible by 4 are leap years
// but years divisible by 100 are not leap years
// but years divisible by 400 are leap years
// Additional Notes:

// Only valid years (positive integers) will be tested, so you don't have to validate them
// Examples can be found in the test fixture.

// P: whole numbers only
// R: whether a given year is a leap year or not
// E: console.log(isLeapYear(2004), true);
//    console.log(isLeapYear(1234), false);
//    console.log(isLeapYear(2010), false);
// P:

// create a function that takes in a given year in whole numbers
function isLeapYear(year) {
