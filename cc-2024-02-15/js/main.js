// PREP

// Task
// Given a Divisor and a Bound , Find the largest integer N , Such That ,

// Conditions :
// N is divisible by divisor

// N is less than or equal to bound

// N is greater than 0.

// Notes
// The parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values .
// It's guaranteed that a divisor is Found .
// Input >> Output Examples
// divisor = 2, bound = 7 ==> return (6)
// Explanation:
// (6) is divisible by (2) , (6) is less than or equal to bound (7) , and (6) is > 0 .

// divisor = 10, bound = 50 ==> return (50)
// Explanation:
// (50) is divisible by (10) , (50) is less than or equal to bound (50) , and (50) is > 0 .*

// divisor = 37, bound = 200 ==> return (185)
// Explanation:
// (185) is divisible by (37) , (185) is less than or equal to bound (200) , and (185) is > 0 .

// P: the parameters (divisor, bound) passed to the function are only positive values greater than 0,
//    whereby the number N is divisible by divisor and N is less than or equal to the upper limit of bound
// R: a number N that is divisible by divisor, less than or equal to bound, and greater than 0
// E: divisor = 2, bound = 7 ==> return (6)
//    Explanation:
//    (6) is divisible by (2) , (6) is less than or equal to bound (7) , and (6) is > 0 .
//
//    divisor = 10, bound = 50 ==> return (50)
//    Explanation:
//    (50) is divisible by (10) , (50) is less than or equal to bound (50) , and (50) is > 0 .
//
//    divisor = 37, bound = 200 ==> return (185)
//    Explanation:
//    (185) is divisible by (37) , (185) is less than or equal to bound (200) , and (185) is > 0 .
// P:

function maxMultiple(divisor, bound) {
