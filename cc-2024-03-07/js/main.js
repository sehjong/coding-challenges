// PREP

// An ordered sequence of numbers from 1 to N is given. One number might have deleted from it, then the remaining numbers were mixed. Find the number that was deleted.

// Example:

// The starting array sequence is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
// The mixed array with one deleted number is [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]
// Your function should return the int 5.
// If no number was deleted from the starting array, your function should return the int 0.

// Note: N may be 1 or less (in the latter case, the first array will be []).

// P: an array of numbers arrNums and a mixed array of numbers arrNumsMix derived from arrNums
// R: the number that was deleted from arrNums to obtain arrNumsMix,
//    if no number was deleted, the function returns 0
// E: console.log(findDeletedNum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9]), 5);
//    console.log(findDeletedNum([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], [3,2,4,6,7,8,1,9,5]), 0);
//    console.log(findDeletedNum([], []), 0);
// P:

// create a function that takes in an array of numbers arrNums and a mixed array of numbers arrNumsMix derived from arrNums
function findDeletedNum(arrNums, arrNumsMix) {
