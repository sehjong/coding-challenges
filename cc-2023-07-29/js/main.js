// PREP

// You'll be given a list of two strings, and each will contain exactly one colon (":") in the middle (but not at beginning or end). The length of the strings, before and after the colon, are random.

// Your job is to return a list of two strings (in the same order as the original list), but with the characters after each colon swapped.

// Examples
// ["abc:123", "cde:456"]  -->  ["abc:456", "cde:123"]
// ["a:12345", "777:xyz"]  -->  ["a:xyz", "777:12345"]

// P: an array of two strings
// R: a list of two strings (in the same order as the original list),
//    but with the characters after each colon swapped
// E: ["abc:123", "cde:456"]  -->  ["abc:456", "cde:123"]
//    ["a:12345", "777:xyz"]  -->  ["a:xyz", "777:12345"]
// P:

// create a function that takes in an array of two strings
function swap(arr) {
