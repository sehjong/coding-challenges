// PREP

// The museum of incredibly dull things
// The museum of incredibly dull things wants to get rid of some exhibits. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

// Examples
// * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
// * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
// * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]

// P: an array of integers
// R: an array of integers with the first occurrence of the lowest rating removed,
//    the original array remains unchanged,
//    return an empty array if the input is empty
// E: * Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output = [2,3,4,5]
// * Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
// * Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
// P:

// create a function that takes in an array of integers
function removeMinimum(nums) {
