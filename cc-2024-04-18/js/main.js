// PREP

// In this Kata, you will be given a string that has lowercase letters and numbers. Your task is to compare the number groupings and return the largest number. Numbers will not have leading zeros.

// For example, solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings.

// Good luck!

// P: a single string consisting of lowercase letters and numbers
// R: the largest number found in the string,
//    if no numbers are found, return 0
// E: solve("gh12cdy695m1") = 695, because this is the largest of all number groupings
// P:

function solve(str) {
