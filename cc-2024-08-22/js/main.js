// PREP

/*
In this kata, your goal is to write a function which will reverse the vowels in a string. Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:

"Hello!" => "Holle!"
"Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
"Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.

Good luck!

// P: a string
// R: a new string where the vowels have been reversed, while non-vowel characters remain unchanged
// E: "Hello!" => "Holle!"
//    "Tomatoes" => "Temotaos"
//    "Reverse Vowels In A String" => "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"
// P:

// create a function expression that takes in a string
const reverseVowels = (str) => {
